# Best-Service
Page of "Best Service" located in Wi≈õlina, Poland https://eliveruss.github.io/Best-Service/ or https://bestservice-wislina.pl/

This project is the one-page website of the car service.
The structure is very simply and common - HTML file combined with CSS and vanilla JavaScript. All images used on the site are placed in "images" folder.

Mobile and desktop versions are almost the same.
The main difference is the stack of services set vertically for devices below 1280px and horizontally with background image appearing for devices above 1280px. Other differences are simply media queries like adjusted sizes, 
number of rows, etc.

This website includes only couple functions written in JS, i.e. popups, burger menu and image swiper. 
Image swiper was made with jsDevilr swiper bundle.
