# Best-Service
Website of "Best Service" located in Wi≈õlina, Poland https://eliveruss.github.io/Best-Service/ or https://bestservice-wislina.pl/

This project is a one-page website for a car service. The structure is very simple and common - an HTML file combined with CSS and vanilla JavaScript. All images used on the site are placed in the "images" folder.

The mobile and desktop versions are almost the same. The main difference is the arrangement of services, which is set vertically for devices below 1280px and horizontally with a background image appearing for devices above 1280px. Other differences are simply media queries, such as adjusted sizes and number of rows.

This website includes only a few functions written in JS, such as popups, a burger menu, and an image swiper. The image swiper was made with the jsDevilr swiper bundle.
